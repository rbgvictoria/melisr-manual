Information about herbarium transactions is recorded in the **Interactions** module in Specify. Two separate collections are used to record details of MEL transactions: outgoing loans, donations and exchange are recorded in the *National Herbarium of Victoria* collection, and incoming loans are recorded in the *Non-MEL loans* collection.

## Loans

In MELISR, loans of MEL specimens to other institutions are recorded in the **Loan** table. The Loan table has two views: **Loan** and **Loan w/o preps**. The **Loan w/o preps** table allows you to enter data about the loan before specifying which specimens will be part of the loan. See the **Databasing loans** (p. 120) section for more information on how to use the two loan views.

### Loan form

#### Loan

##### Loan number

The MEL loan number comprises two parts, separated by a forward slash:

-   Year – the year the loan was prepared
-   Number – a sequential, four-digit number. The sequence restarts at 0001 each year.

Old loan numbers have been converted to this format based on the year they were sent out (e.g. MEL loan 210 = 1974/0210).

This field fills automatically when the loan record is saved; however, the loan number needs to be entered manually for the first loan in each calendar year and for transferred loans.

Note that the abbreviation for the recipient institution (e.g. CANB) appears after the loan number but is not part of the loan number. The abbreviation is taken from the institution in the **Sent to** field when the record is saved.

##### Loan status

The current status of the loan. The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Awaiting acknowledgement – loan has been sent, but the yellow acknowledgement form has not been received at MEL
-   Complete – all loan preparations have been returned to MEL (or transferred to another institution)
-   Current – all or some preparations are still on loan
-   New – the loan is being prepared
-   Not serviced – the loan request was received but not serviced
-   Written off – the loan has been closed because the specimens have been lost or destroyed.

##### Quantity on loan

The number of preparations that are on loan. This field fills automatically when loan preparations are added or returned.

##### Date requested

The date the recipient institution requested the loan (i.e. date of formal loan request).

##### Current due date

The date by which the loan is due to be returned to MEL. For loans where an extension has been granted, the **Current due date** should be updated.

##### Extension granted

A check box indicating if an extension has been granted. The new due date should be recorded in **Current due date**. Details of who granted the extension and the date are recorded in the **Description** field, and should be prefixed by a double pipe (||).

##### Original due date

The date by which the loan was originally due to be returned to MEL. For loans where no extension has been granted, the **Original due date** will be the same as the **Current due date**.

##### Description

A short summary of the contents of loan. For example:

-   *‘Utricularia* specimens set aside during visit to MEL on 13 Sep 2010’
-   ‘Selected Victorian specimens of *Epacris impressa’*.

This description appears on the loan paperwork. Subsequent comments should be prefixed by a double pipe ( ‘||’), for example:

-   ‘Selected Victorian specimens of *Epacris impressa.* || Extension granted by J.Smith, 4/4/2011.’

##### Project

This field is used to indicate if a loan was requested for a particular project. ‘Flora of Australia Project’ is currently the only project in the pick list.

##### Destructive sampling permitted

A check box to indicate if destructive sampling has been approved (either at the time the loan was prepared, or subsequently). Details of destructive sampling permission should be included in **Conditions**.

##### Conditions

Any conditions other than the standard MEL loan conditions, such as details of permission for destructive sampling to be undertaken.

##### Acknowledged

The date of receipt of the loan at the receiving institution (as recorded on the yellow acknowledgement slip).

##### Received comments

Comments noted by the receiving institution on the yellow acknowledgement slip (e.g. damage to specimen(s), discrepancies between specimens sent and loan list).

##### Loan notice

Details of the most recent notice sent to the receiving institution regarding the loan. Details of previous notices are recorded in the **Description** field, prefixed by a double pipe (‘||’). The following values can be selected from the pick list:

-   Acknowledgement request
-   Extension
-   Overdue
-   Recall
-   Reminder.

##### Notice sent

The date on which the most recent notice was sent to the receiving institution.

##### Loan closed

The date on which all loaned specimens are processed as returned. For full loan transfers, this is the date on which the loan is acknowledged as received by the institution to which it was transferred.

##### Loan transfer no. 

For transferred loans (full or partial), the loan number to which the loan has been transferred. For loan transfers, the year and number components stay the same, but the institution code changes to that of the institution to which the loan has been transferred. For example, if loan 1974/0210 CANB is transferred to AD, the transferred loan number is 1974/0210 AD.

#### Loan agents

##### Name

The botanist(s) and/or student(s) on behalf of whom the loan was requested. A loan may have multiple loan agents (e.g. student and supervisor(s)).

    -   **Prepared by**.

4.  Save the loan record. The **Loan number** will be automatically completed when the record is saved.

#### Adding preparations to a loan 

Preparations are added to a loan by a Curation Officer. Note that it’s not possible to add a preparation to a loan while databasing a specimen.

To add preparations to an existing **Loan** record:

1.  Create a record set using one of the following methods:

    -   Open the **Record set creator** and scan barcodes into the **MEL barcodes** text box. Select **Create record set** and name the record set with the loan number (e.g. 2011/0011 NSW). Note that you’ll need to exit and log back into MELISR to access the record set.
    
    -   Open the **Record set creator** and scan barcodes into the **MEL barcodes** text box. Select **Create barcode string**. Copy and paste the barcode string into the **Barcode** field in the **Collection object** table in the **Query builder**. Select ‘In’ as the **Operator** and run the query. Save the results as a record set by clicking on the **Record set** symbol in the results bar. Name the record set with the loan number – note that ‘/’ must be replaced with ‘-‘ (e.g. 2011-0011 NSW), because record set names can’t include a forward slash.
    
    -   Scan barcodes directly into the **Barcode** field in the **Collection object** table in the **Query builder**. Use a comma after each barcode. Select ‘In’ as the **Operator** and run the query. Save the results as a record set by clicking on the **Record set** symbol in the results bar. Name the record set with the loan number – note that ‘/’ must be replaced with ‘-‘ (e.g. 2011-0011 NSW), because record set names can’t include a forward slash.
    
    -   For spirit or microscope slide preparations, create a record set by querying on the spirit/slide number in the **Preparation** table.
    
    {: .alert .alert-info }

    *Note:* more than one record set can be added to a loan record.

2.  In MELISR, find the loan by searching for the loan number in either the **Simple search** (e.g. ‘2011/0001\*’) or the **Loan number** field (in the **Loan** table) in the **Query builder**

3.  Open the **Loan** form and click **Edit**

4.  Click the **Add** symbol in the **Loan preparations** form

5.  Select **Record sets and information requests** when prompted to choose the source of the preparations

6.  Select the relevant record set from the list and click **OK**

7.  In the **Create loan from preparations** window, click **Select all**, scan through the list and deselect any preparations that are not part of the loan (e.g. microscope slides). Note that duplicate preparations don’t need to be deselected at this point (see step 10).

8.  Click **OK**

9.  Save the **Loan** record

10.  Open the [Herbarium transaction paperwork](http://melisr.rbg.vic.gov.au/transactions) and, in the **Loans** section, select the loan from the drop-down list and click **Delete ‘duplicate’ loan preparations**.

#### Deleting preparations from a loan 

The Team Leader Collections Curation and Curation Officers can delete preparations from a loan. A loan preparation should only be deleted if it was erroneously added (e.g. if the wrong MEL number was entered), and only before the loan is dispatched. See the Team Leader Collections Curation if a preparation needs to deleted after the loan has been sent.

#### Adding shipment details to a loan

Shipment details are added to a loan by a Curation Officer once the specimens have been checked, scanned and packed.

1.  Add details to the following fields:

-   **Date sent**

<!-- -->

-   **Method** – the postal category used to send the shipment

-   **Reference no(s)** – the tracking reference number(s) for parcels (e.g. Registered Post, Customs Insured). Scan labels directly into this field, using a comma to separate entries. Ensure that the shipment method matches the label type.

-   **Number of parcels**

-   **Weight** – total weight of all parcels in the consignment

-   **Postage** – total cost of postage (calculate the postage using the online [Australia Post calculator](https://auspost.com.au/parcels-mail/calculate-postage-delivery-times/#/))

-   **Comments** – e.g. notable damage to a specimen.

1.  Change the **Loan status** from ‘New’ to ‘Awaiting acknowledgement’

2.  Save the **Loan** record.

### Databasing outgoing donations and exchange

#### How to process outgoing exchange, donation or shipping material

1.  Create a record set for the preparations in the consignment using one of the following methods:

    For large consignments (more than ten specimens):

    -   Open the **Record set creator** (http://melisr.rbg.vic.gov.au/recordset) and scan barcodes into the **MEL barcodes** text box and select **Create record set**. You’ll need to exit and log back into MELISR to access the record set.
    
        OR
    
    -   Open the **Record set creator** and scan barcodes into the **MEL barcodes** text box. Select **Create barcode string**. Copy and paste the barcode string into the **Barcode** field (in the **Collection object** table) in the **Query builder**. Select ‘In’ as the **Operator** and run the query. Save the results as a record set by clicking on the **Record set** symbol in the results bar.
    

    For small consignments (fewer than ten specimens):
    
    -   Open the **Query** **builder** and select the **Barcode** field from the **Collection object** table. Select ‘In’ as the **Operator** and scan the barcodes into the search box (use a comma between each barcode). Run the query and save the results as a record set by clicking on the **Record set** symbol in the results bar.
    
    {: .alert .alert-info }
    *Note:* multiple record sets can be added to a gift record.

2.  In MELISR, click **Interactions** in the task bar

3.  Click **Gift** in the side bar

8.  **Save** the form. Select **Exit** when prompted to print a Gift invoice

9.  Open the **Exchange metadata** page (http://melisr.rbg.vic.gov.au/exchangedata) and select the relevant exchange consignment from the **Exchange** drop-down list

10.  If the consignment contains records that have been created or edited on the day they’re being sent, click on the **Update BioCASe** button

11.  Select the **Output format** (refer to the agent record to check which file type to send) and press **Submit**

12.  Name the file using the gift number (e.g. MEL exchange 1602 PAL) and save it to the relevant folder in `S:\\COLLECT\\Loans & exchange\\Exchange\\Outgoing exchange`

13.  Add the **File name** to the **Gift** record in MELISR

14.  Open the herbarium transactions page (http://melisr.rbg.vic.gov.au/transactions) and select the relevant exchange consignment from the drop-down list

19.  Using the HerbMEL account, e-mail the exchange paperwork and data to the receiving institution (refer to the agent record for contact details). Record the file name in the subject line (e.g. MEL exchange 1602).

#### How to enter outgoing shipping material using a dummy record

MEL occasionally ships specimens, samples or other materials that are not linked to MEL specimens (e.g. recently collected non-MEL specimens, unvouchered pollen samples). In such cases, a dummy record needs to be used in order to create a **Gift** record:

1.  Open the dummy record MEL 999999A in MELISR and edit the preparation type and quantity in accordance with the type and quantity of material to be sent

2.  Open the **Interactions** module and click **Gift** in the side bar

3.  Select **Enter Catalogue Numbers** when prompted to choose source of preparations

4.  Enter 9999999A

5.  Select the **Preparation type** and **Quantity** and follow steps 7 and 14–19 as above

6.  Return to the **Gift** record, delete the dummy preparation and save the record.

#### Deleting preparations from a gift record

The Team Leader Collections Curation and Curation Officers can delete preparations from a gift. A preparation should only be deleted from a gift before the consignment is dispatched (except in the case of shipping material consignments created using a dummy record). See the Team Leader Collections Curation if a preparation needs to deleted after a consignment has been sent.

#### Sending silica gel samples as shipping material

Where material from a silica gel sample is sent to a researcher to be used for destructive sampling, the silica gel sample preparation should be added to the relevant **Gift** record (i.e. there is no need to create a separate shipping material preparation). When adding ‘Silica gel sample’ preparations to a **Gift** record, each preparation needs to be flagged manually. Do not ‘Select all’ and use the ‘Clever button thing’, as this will delete the silica gel sample preparations from the record.

If the entire silica gel sample is used, the quantity in the ‘Silica gel sample’ preparation should be changed to ‘0’ after the material is sent. If only part of the silica gel sample is used, the quantity will need to be adjusted retrospectively to reflect the number of consignments of shipping material that the silica gel sample preparation is linked to (e.g. if material from a single silica gel sample preparation is sent to two separate researchers, and there is still material at MEL, the quantity in the ‘Silica gel sample’ should be ‘3’).

Remember to follow the destructive sampling procedure when processing material, including filling in the **Destructive sampling** fields in the **Conservator event** table.

## Incoming exchange

Incoming consignments of exchange, donations and shipping material are recorded in the **Exchange in** table.

### Exchange in form

#### Exchange in

##### Exchange number
