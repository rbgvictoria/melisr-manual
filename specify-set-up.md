### Opening and closing Specify

    If you are presented with an **Updater** window, click **Cancel** to prevent Specify from updating your current installation. Updates to new versions must only be done by database administrators so we can ensure that the new version works properly with our customisation of Specify.

If you are unsure of your master key, see a database administrator.

##### Choose a collection

There are seven different &#39;collections&#39; within MELISR, which are used to catalogue different types of information and to manage data for curation tasks. All users have access to the main _National Herbarium of Victoria_ collection. If you have access to other collections, you will be presented with a window prompting you to choose which collection you want to use.

-   **Incoming exchange** – a holding database used to manage and check data associated with incoming exchange,    prior to adding the records to the _National Herbarium of Victoria_ collection
-   **MEL Census** – holds the data from the old MEL Census, which contains information on MEL&#39;s holdings
-   **National Herbarium of Victoria** – the principal collection in MELISR, used to catalogue specimens from the main component of the State Botanical Collection
-   **Non-MEL loans** – used to manage incoming loans
-   **Photographs of specimens­** – used to catalogue photographs or cibachromes of specimens held at other herbaria
-   **Victorian Conservation Seed Bank­­** – used to catalogue seed collections and associated seedlings from the Victorian Conservation Seed Bank
